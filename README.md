# Discord Bot Minecraft Server Controller

# English section

- Presentation

This project an open source Discord bot for controlling a self-hosted Minecraft server, course. It let you self-host you own iteration of this bot for making it interacting with your Minecraft server.
In fact, I made this project so that when I am self-hosting a Minecraft server, my friends not forced to send me a message, learn what a linux CLI is, and use some weird custom vpn and homemade derogations to access my proxmox.

The best question is : "Why not just let the server run all the time ?"
This seems and obvious and reasonnable way to solve the issue, but this method have few problems...

First and foremost, a MC server using a LOT of ram, and can use a lot of CPU too if, as me, you have friends fans of redstone machine and redstone computer and I'd like this to be a joke :( 
Moreover, a server running all the time mean, no auto updates, and can lead to some weird and verry annoying issue (I had some worlds files corrupted, and I things the 24/7 a lead...)

So I made accessible controlling the server for all my friends using Discord !

And more importantly I AM NOT a programmation maniac, I already know that my code could be better, easier, lighter and more reliable (I have ambiguous thought toward the Popen method). But if you have suggestion, feel free to telle me ! And for the devellopement prodigys, I'll be honored merge your code, knowing mine far from perfect.

Last thing, if you read the English section, you might already know that I am a frenchman. So, sorry for the potentials mistakes I'll make, or I have alredy made...
